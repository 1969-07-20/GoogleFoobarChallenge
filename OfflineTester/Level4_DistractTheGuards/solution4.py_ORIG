    We don't pair off trainers with the same number of bananas (if we do, their game will end and they will go back to

    loses. Once a match begins, the pair of trainers will continue to thumb wrestle and exchange bananas, until both
    of them have the same number of bananas. Once that happens, both of them will lose interest and go back to
    supervising the bunny workers, and you don't want THAT to happen!
