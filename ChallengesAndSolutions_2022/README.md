# Google Foobar Challenge (2022)
This directory contains my solutions to the challenges I was given in the second time I took the Google Foobar Challenge (in 2022).  [A sibling directory](https://github.com/1969-07-20/GoogleFoobarChallenge/tree/master/ChallengesAndSolutions_2020) has my solutions the first time I took the challenge in 2020.

The following are the problem statements to the challenges I was given the second time in 2022.


# Level 1, Challenge 1:  Re-ID

There's some unrest in the minion ranks: minions with ID numbers like "1", "42", and other "good" numbers have been lording it over the poor minions who are stuck with more boring IDs. To quell the unrest, Commander Lambda has tasked you with reassigning everyone new, random IDs based on her Completely Foolproof Scheme.

She's concatenated the prime numbers in a single long string: "2357111317192329...". Now every minion must draw a number from a hat. That number is the starting index in that string of primes, and the minion's new ID number will be the next five digits in the string. So if a minion draws "3", their ID number will be "71113".

Help the Commander assign these IDs by writing a function solution(n) which takes in the starting index n of Lambda's string of all primes, and returns the next five digits in the string. Commander Lambda has a lot of minions, so the value of n will always be between 0 and 10000.


# Level 2, Challenge 1:  Hey, I Already Did That!

Commander Lambda uses an automated algorithm to assign minions randomly to tasks, in order to keep her minions on their toes. But you've noticed a flaw in the algorithm - it eventually loops back on itself, so that instead of assigning new minions as it iterates, it gets stuck in a cycle of values so that the same minions end up doing the same tasks over and over again. You think proving this to Commander Lambda will help you make a case for your next promotion.

You have worked out that the algorithm has the following process:

1. Start with a random minion ID n, which is a nonnegative integer of length k in base b
2. Define x and y as integers of length k.  x has the digits of n in descending order, and y has the digits of n in ascending order
3. Define z = x - y.  Add leading zeros to z to maintain length k if necessary
4. Assign n = z to get the next minion ID, and go back to step 2

For example, given minion ID n = 1211, k = 4, b = 10, then x = 2111, y = 1112 and z = 2111 - 1112 = 0999. Then the next minion ID will be n = 0999 and the algorithm iterates again: x = 9990, y = 0999 and z = 9990 - 0999 = 8991, and so on.

Depending on the values of n, k (derived from n), and b, at some point the algorithm reaches a cycle, such as by reaching a constant value. For example, starting with n = 210022, k = 6, b = 3, the algorithm will reach the cycle of values [210111, 122221, 102212] and it will stay in this cycle no matter how many times it continues iterating. Starting with n = 1211, the routine will reach the integer 6174, and since 7641 - 1467 is 6174, it will stay as that value no matter how many times it iterates.

Given a minion ID as a string n representing a nonnegative integer of length k in base b, where 2 <= k <= 9 and 2 <= b <= 10, write a function solution(n, b) which returns the length of the ending cycle of the algorithm above starting with n. For instance, in the example above, solution(210022, 3) would return 3, since iterating on 102212 would return to 210111 when done in base 3. If the algorithm reaches a constant, such as 0, then the length is 1.


# Level 2, Challenge 2:  Power Hungry

Commander Lambda's space station is HUGE. And huge space stations take a LOT of power. Huge space stations with doomsday devices take even more power. To help meet the station's power needs, Commander Lambda has installed solar panels on the station's outer surface. But the station sits in the middle of a quasar quantum flux field, which wreaks havoc on the solar panels. You and your team of henchmen has been assigned to repair the solar panels, but you can't take them all down at once without shutting down the space station (and all those pesky life support systems!).

You need to figure out which sets of panels in any given array you can take offline to repair while still maintaining the maximum amount of power output per array, and to do THAT, you'll first need to figure out what the maximum output of each array actually is. Write a function answer(xs) that takes a list of integers representing the power output levels of each panel in an array, and returns the maximum product of some non-empty subset of those numbers. So for example, if an array contained panels with power output levels of [2, -3, 1, 0, -5], then the maximum product would be found by taking the subset: xs[0] = 2, xs[1] = -3, xs[4] = -5, giving the product 2*(-3)*(-5) = 30. So answer([2,-3,1,0,-5]) will be "30".

Each array of solar panels contains at least 1 and no more than 50 panels, and each panel will have a power output level whose absolute value is no greater than 1000 (some panels are malfunctioning so badly that they're draining energy, but you know a trick with the panels' wave stabilizer that lets you combine two negative-output panels to produce the positive output of the multiple of their power values). The final products may be very large, so give the answer as a string representation of the number.


# Level 3, Challenge 1:  The Grandest Staircase Of Them All

With her LAMBCHOP doomsday device finished, Commander Lambda is preparing for her debut on the galactic stage - but in order to make a grand entrance, she needs a grand staircase! As her personal assistant, you've been tasked with figuring out how to build the best staircase EVER.

Lambda has given you an overview of the types of bricks available, plus a budget. You can buy different amounts of the different types of bricks (for example, 3 little pink bricks, or 5 blue lace bricks). Commander Lambda wants to know how many different types of staircases can be built with each amount of bricks, so she can pick the one with the most options.

Each type of staircase should consist of 2 or more steps.  No two steps are allowed to be at the same height - each step must be lower than the previous one. All steps must contain at least one brick. A step's height is classified as the total amount of bricks that make up that step.

For example, when N = 3, you have only 1 choice of how to build the staircase, with the first step having a height of 2 and the second step having a height of 1: (# indicates a brick)

```
#
##
21
```

When N = 4, you still only have 1 staircase choice:

```
#
#
##
31
```

But when N = 5, there are two ways you can build a staircase from the given bricks. The two staircases can have heights (4, 1) or (3, 2), as shown below:

```
#
#
#
##
41
```

```
#
##
##
32
```

Write a function called solution(n) that takes a positive integer n and returns the number of different staircases that can be built from exactly n bricks. n will always be at least 3 (so you can have a staircase at all), but no more than 200, because Commander Lambda's not made of money!


# Level 3, Challenge 2:  Fuel Injection Perfection

Commander Lambda has asked for your help to refine the automatic quantum antimatter fuel injection system for her LAMBCHOP doomsday device. It's a great chance for you to get a closer look at the LAMBCHOP - and maybe sneak in a bit of sabotage while you're at it - so you took the job gladly.

Quantum antimatter fuel comes in small pellets, which is convenient since the many moving parts of the LAMBCHOP each need to be fed fuel one pellet at a time. However, minions dump pellets in bulk into the fuel intake. You need to figure out the most efficient way to sort and shift the pellets down to a single pellet at a time.

The fuel control mechanisms have three operations:

1. Add one fuel pellet
2. Remove one fuel pellet
3. Divide the entire group of fuel pellets by 2 (due to the destructive energy released when a quantum antimatter pellet is cut in half, the safety controls will only allow this to happen if there is an even number of pellets)

Write a function called answer(n) which takes a positive integer as a string and returns the minimum number of operations needed to transform the number of pellets to 1. The fuel intake control panel can only display a number up to 309 digits long, so there won't ever be more pellets than you can express in that many digits.

For example:

    answer(4) returns 2: 4 -> 2 -> 1
    answer(15) returns 5: 15 -> 16 -> 8 -> 4 -> 2 -> 1


# Level 3, Challenge 3:  Prepare the Bunnies' Escape

You're awfully close to destroying the LAMBCHOP doomsday device and freeing Commander Lambda's bunny workers, but once they're free of the work duties the bunnies are going to need to escape Lambda's space station via the escape pods as quickly as possible. Unfortunately, the halls of the space station are a maze of corridors and dead ends that will be a deathtrap for the escaping bunnies. Fortunately, Commander Lambda has put you in charge of a remodeling project that will give you the opportunity to make things a little easier for the bunnies. Unfortunately (again), you can't just remove all obstacles between the bunnies and the escape pods - at most you can remove one wall per escape pod path, both to maintain structural integrity of the station and to avoid arousing Commander Lambda's suspicions.

You have maps of parts of the space station, each starting at a work area exit and ending at the door to an escape pod. The map is represented as a matrix of 0s and 1s, where 0s are passable space and 1s are impassable walls. The door out of the station is at the top left (0,0) and the door into an escape pod is at the bottom right (w-1,h-1).

Write a function solution(map) that generates the length of the shortest path from the station door to the escape pod, where you are allowed to remove one wall as part of your remodeling plans. The path length is the total number of nodes you pass through, counting both the entrance and exit nodes. The starting and ending positions are always passable (0). The map will always be solvable, though you may or may not need to remove a wall. The height and width of the map can be from 2 to 20. Moves can only be made in cardinal directions; no diagonal moves are allowed.


# Doomsday Fuel

Making fuel for the LAMBCHOP's reactor core is a tricky process because of the exotic matter involved. It starts as raw ore, then during processing, begins randomly changing between forms, eventually reaching a stable form. There may be multiple stable forms that a sample could ultimately reach, not all of which are useful as fuel. 

Commander Lambda has tasked you to help the scientists increase fuel creation efficiency by predicting the end state of a given ore sample. You have carefully studied the different structures that the ore can take and which transitions it undergoes. It appears that, while random, the probability of each structure transforming is fixed. That is, each time the ore is in 1 state, it has the same probabilities of entering the next state (which might be the same state).  You have recorded the observed transitions in a matrix. The others in the lab have hypothesized more exotic forms that the ore can become, but you haven't seen all of them.

Write a function solution(m) that takes an array of array of nonnegative ints representing how many times that state has gone to the next state and return an array of ints for each terminal state giving the exact probabilities of each terminal state, represented as the numerator for each state, then the denominator for all of them at the end and in simplest form. The matrix is at most 10 by 10. It is guaranteed that no matter which state the ore is in, there is a path from that state to a terminal state. That is, the processing will always eventually end in a stable state. The ore starts in state 0. The denominator will fit within a signed 32-bit integer during the calculation, as long as the fraction is simplified regularly. 

For example, consider the matrix m:

```
[
  [0,1,0,0,0,1],  # s0, the initial state, goes to s1 and s5 with equal probability
  [4,0,0,3,2,0],  # s1 can become s0, s3, or s4, but with different probabilities
  [0,0,0,0,0,0],  # s2 is terminal, and unreachable (never observed in practice)
  [0,0,0,0,0,0],  # s3 is terminal
  [0,0,0,0,0,0],  # s4 is terminal
  [0,0,0,0,0,0],  # s5 is terminal
]
```

So, we can consider different paths to terminal states, such as:
```
s0 -> s1 -> s3
s0 -> s1 -> s0 -> s1 -> s0 -> s1 -> s4
s0 -> s1 -> s0 -> s5
```
Tracing the probabilities of each, we find that
```
s2 has probability 0
s3 has probability 3/14
s4 has probability 1/7
s5 has probability 9/14
```
So, putting that together, and making a common denominator, gives an answer in the form of
[s2.numerator, s3.numerator, s4.numerator, s5.numerator, denominator] which is
```
[0, 3, 2, 9, 14].
```


# Ion Flux Relabeling

Oh no! Commander Lambda's latest experiment to improve the efficiency of the LAMBCHOP doomsday device has backfired spectacularly. The Commander had been improving the structure of the ion flux converter tree, but something went terribly wrong and the flux chains exploded. Some of the ion flux converters survived the explosion intact, but others had their position labels blasted off. Commander Lambda is having her henchmen rebuild the ion flux converter tree by hand, but you think you can do it much more quickly -- quickly enough, perhaps, to earn a promotion!

Flux chains require perfect binary trees, so Lambda's design arranged the ion flux converters to form one. To label them, Lambda performed a post-order traversal of the tree of converters and labeled each converter with the order of that converter in the traversal, starting at 1. For example, a tree of 7 converters would look like the following:

```
   7
 3   6
1 2 4 5
```

Write a function solution(h, q) - where h is the height of the perfect tree of converters and q is a list of positive integers representing different flux converters - which returns a list of integers p where each element in p is the label of the converter that sits on top of the respective converter in q, or -1 if there is no such converter.  For example, solution(3, [1, 4, 7]) would return the converters above the converters at indexes 1, 4, and 7 in a perfect binary tree of height 3, which is [3, 6, -1].

The domain of the integer h is 1 <= h <= 30, where h = 1 represents a perfect binary tree containing only the root, h = 2 represents a perfect binary tree with the root and two leaf nodes, h = 3 represents a perfect binary tree with the root, two internal nodes and four leaf nodes (like the example above), and so forth.  The lists q and p contain at least one but no more than 10000 distinct integers, all of which will be between 1 and 2^h-1, inclusive.


# Level 4, Challenge 1:  Running with Bunnies

You and the bunny workers need to get out of this collapsing death trap of a space station -- and fast! Unfortunately, some of the bunnies have been weakened by their long work shifts and can't run very fast. Their friends are trying to help them, but this escape would go a lot faster if you also pitched in. The defensive bulkhead doors have begun to close, and if you don't make it through in time, you'll be trapped! You need to grab as many bunnies as you can and get through the bulkheads before they close.

The time it takes to move from your starting point to all of the bunnies and to the bulkhead will be given to you in a square matrix of integers. Each row will tell you the time it takes to get to the start, first bunny, second bunny, ..., last bunny, and the bulkhead in that order. The order of the rows follows the same pattern (start, each bunny, bulkhead). The bunnies can jump into your arms, so picking them up is instantaneous, and arriving at the bulkhead at the same time as it seals still allows for a successful, if dramatic, escape. (Don't worry, any bunnies you don't pick up will be able to escape with you since they no longer have to carry the ones you did pick up.) You can revisit different spots if you wish, and moving to the bulkhead doesn't mean you have to immediately leave -- you can move to and from the bulkhead to pick up additional bunnies if time permits.

In addition to spending time traveling between bunnies, some paths interact with the space station's security checkpoints and add time back to the clock. Adding time to the clock will delay the closing of the bulkhead doors, and if the time goes back up to 0 or a positive number after the doors have already closed, it triggers the bulkhead to reopen. Therefore, it might be possible to walk in a circle and keep gaining time: that is, each time a path is traversed, the same amount of time is used or added.

Write a function of the form solution(times, time_limit) to calculate the most bunnies you can pick up and which bunnies they are, while still escaping through the bulkhead before the doors close for good. If there are multiple sets of bunnies of the same size, return the set of bunnies with the lowest worker IDs (as indexes) in sorted order. The bunnies are represented as a sorted list by worker ID, with the first bunny being 0. There are at most 5 bunnies, and time_limit is a non-negative integer that is at most 999.

Q:  What is the "lowest worker IDs":  lowest sum or earliest position sorted order?

For instance, in the case of

```
[
  [0, 2, 2, 2, -1],  # 0 = Start
  [9, 0, 2, 2, -1],  # 1 = Bunny 0
  [9, 3, 0, 2, -1],  # 2 = Bunny 1
  [9, 3, 2, 0, -1],  # 3 = Bunny 2
  [9, 3, 2, 2,  0],  # 4 = Bulkhead
]
```

and a time limit of 1, the five inner array rows designate the starting point, bunny 0, bunny 1, bunny 2, and the bulkhead door exit respectively. You could take the path:

```
Start End Delta Time Status
    -   0     -    1 Bulkhead initially open
    0   4    -1    2
    4   2     2    0
    2   4    -1    1
    4   3     2   -1 Bulkhead closes
    3   4    -1    0 Bulkhead reopens; you and the bunnies exit
```

With this solution, you would pick up bunnies 1 and 2. This is the best combination for this space station hallway, so the solution is [1, 2].


# Level 4, Challenge 2:  Bringing a Gun to a Trainer Fight

Uh-oh -- you've been cornered by one of Commander Lambdas elite bunny trainers! Fortunately, you grabbed a beam weapon from an abandoned storeroom while you were running through the station, so you have a chance to fight your way out. But the beam weapon is potentially dangerous to you as well as to the bunny trainers: its beams reflect off walls, meaning you'll have to be very careful where you shoot to avoid bouncing a shot toward yourself!

Luckily, the beams can only travel a certain maximum distance before becoming too weak to cause damage. You also know that if a beam hits a corner, it will bounce back in exactly the same direction. And of course, if the beam hits either you or the bunny trainer, it will stop immediately (albeit painfully).

Write a function solution(dimensions, your_position, trainer_position, distance) that gives an array of 2 integers of the width and height of the room, an array of 2 integers of your x and y coordinates in the room, an array of 2 integers of the trainer's x and y coordinates in the room, and returns an integer of the number of distinct directions that you can fire to hit the elite trainer, given the maximum distance that the beam can travel.

The room has integer dimensions [1 < x_dim <= 1250, 1 < y_dim <= 1250]. You and the elite trainer are both positioned on the integer lattice at different distinct positions (x, y) inside the room such that [0 < x < x_dim, 0 < y < y_dim]. Finally, the maximum distance that the beam can travel before becoming harmless will be given as an integer 1 < distance <= 10000.

For example, if you and the elite trainer were positioned in a room with dimensions [3, 2], your_position [1, 1], trainer_position [2, 1], and a maximum shot distance of 4, you could shoot in seven different directions to hit the elite trainer (given as vector bearings from your location): [1, 0], [1, 2], [1, -2], [3, 2], [3, -2], [-3, 2], and [-3, -2]. As specific examples, the shot at bearing [1, 0] is the straight line horizontal shot of distance 1, the shot at bearing [-3, -2] bounces off the left wall and then the bottom wall before hitting the elite trainer with a total shot distance of sqrt(13), and the shot at bearing [1, 2] bounces off just the top wall before hitting the elite trainer with a total shot distance of sqrt(5).


# Level 4, Bonus 1:  Escape Pods

You've blown up the LAMBCHOP doomsday device and relieved the bunnies of their work duries -- and now you need to escape from the space station as quickly and as orderly as possible! The bunnies have all gathered in various locations throughout the station, and need to make their way towards the seemingly endless amount of escape pods positioned in other parts of the station. You need to get the numerous bunnies through the various rooms to the escape pods. Unfortunately, the corridors between the rooms can only fit so many bunnies at a time. What's more, many of the corridors were resized to accommodate the LAMBCHOP, so they vary in how many bunnies can move through them at a time. 

Given the starting room numbers of the groups of bunnies, the room numbers of the escape pods, and how many bunnies can fit through at a time in each direction of every corridor in between, figure out how many bunnies can safely make it to the escape pods at a time at peak.

Write a function solution(entrances, exits, path) that takes an array of integers denoting where the groups of gathered bunnies are, an array of integers denoting where the escape pods are located, and an array of an array of integers of the corridors, returning the total number of bunnies that can get through at each time step as an int. The entrances and exits are disjoint and thus will never overlap. The path element path[A][B] = C describes that the corridor going from A to B can fit C bunnies at each time step.  There are at most 50 rooms connected by the corridors and at most 2000000 bunnies that will fit at a time.

For example, if you have:
```
entrances = [0, 1]
exits = [4, 5]
path = [
  [0, 0, 4, 6, 0, 0],  # Room 0: Bunnies
  [0, 0, 5, 2, 0, 0],  # Room 1: Bunnies
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4],  # Room 2: Intermediate room
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6],  # Room 3: Intermediate room
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],  # Room 4: Escape pods
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],  # Room 5: Escape pods
]
```

Then in each time step, the following might happen:
```
0 sends 4/4 bunnies to 2 and 6/6 bunnies to 3
1 sends 4/5 bunnies to 2 and 2/2 bunnies to 3
2 sends 4/4 bunnies to 4 and 4/4 bunnies to 5
3 sends 4/6 bunnies to 4 and 4/6 bunnies to 5
```

So, in total, 16 bunnies could make it to the escape pods at 4 and 5 at each time step.  (Note that in this example, room 3 could have sent any variation of 8 bunnies to 4 and 5, such as 2/6 and 6/6, but the final solution remains the same.)


# Level 4, Bonus 2:  Free the Bunny Workers

You need to free the bunny workers before Commander Lambda's space station explodes! Unfortunately, the Commander was very careful with the highest-value workers -- they all work in separate, maximum-security work rooms. The rooms are opened by putting keys into each console, then pressing the open button on each console simultaneously. When the open button is pressed, each key opens its corresponding lock on the work room. So, the union of the keys in all of the consoles must be all of the keys. The scheme may require multiple copies of one key given to different minions.

The consoles are far enough apart that a separate minion is needed for each one. Fortunately, you have already relieved some bunnies to aid you - and even better, you were able to steal the keys while you were working as Commander Lambda's assistant. The problem is, you don't know which keys to use at which consoles. The consoles are programmed to know which keys each minion had, to prevent someone from just stealing all of the keys and using them blindly. There are signs by the consoles saying how many minions had some keys for the set of consoles. You suspect that Commander Lambda has a systematic way to decide which keys to give to each minion such that they could use the consoles.

You need to figure out the scheme that Commander Lambda used to distribute the keys. You know how many minions had keys, and how many consoles are by each work room.  You know that Command Lambda wouldn't issue more keys than necessary (beyond what the key distribution scheme requires), and that you need as many bunnies with keys as there are consoles to open the work room.

Given the number of bunnies available and the number of locks required to open a work room, write a function solution(num_buns, num_required) which returns a specification of how to distribute the keys such that any num_required bunnies can open the locks, but no group of (num_required - 1) bunnies can.

Each lock is numbered starting from 0. The keys are numbered the same as the lock they open (so for a duplicate key, the number will repeat, since it opens the same lock). For a given bunny, the keys they get is represented as a sorted list of the numbers for the keys. To cover all of the bunnies, the final solution is represented by a sorted list of each individual bunny's list of keys.  Find the lexicographically least such key distribution - that is, the first bunny should have keys sequentially starting from 0.

num_buns will always be between 1 and 9, and num_required will always be between 0 and 9 (both inclusive).  For example, if you had 3 bunnies and required only 1 of them to open the cell, you would give each bunny the same key such that any of the 3 of them would be able to open it, like so:
```
[
  [0],
  [0],
  [0],
]
```

If you had 2 bunnies and required both of them to open the cell, they would receive different keys (otherwise they wouldn't both actually be required), and your solution would be as follows:
```
[
  [0],
  [1],
]
```

Finally, if you had 3 bunnies and required 2 of them to open the cell, then any 2 of the 3 bunnies should have all of the keys necessary to open the cell, but no single bunny would be able to do it.  Thus, the solution would be:
```
[
  [0, 1],
  [0, 2],
  [1, 2],
]
```


# Level 4, Bonus 3:  Find the Access Codes

In order to destroy Commander Lambda's LAMBCHOP doomsday device, you'll need access to it. But the only door leading to the LAMBCHOP chamber is secured with a unique lock system whose number of passcodes changes daily. Commander Lambda gets a report every day that includes the locks' access codes, but only the Commander knows how to figure out which of several lists contains the access codes. You need to find a way to determine which list contains the access codes once you're ready to go in.

Fortunately, now that you're Commander Lambda's personal assistant, Lambda has confided to you that all the access codes are "lucky triples" in order to make it easier to find them in the lists. A "lucky triple" is a tuple (x, y, z) where x divides y and y divides z, such as (1, 2, 4). With that information, you can figure out which list contains the number of access codes that matches the number of locks on the door when you're ready to go in (for example, if there's 5 passcodes, you'd need to find a list with 5 "lucky triple" access codes).

Write a function solution(l) that takes a list of positive integers l and counts the number of "lucky triples" of (li, lj, lk) where the list indices meet the requirement i < j < k.  The length of l is between 2 and 2000 inclusive.  The elements of l are between 1 and 999999 inclusive.  The solution fits within a signed 32-bit integer. Some of the lists are purposely generated without any access codes to throw off spies, so if no triples are found, return 0.

For example, [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] has the triples: [1, 2, 4], [1, 2, 6], [1, 3, 6], making the solution 3 total.


# Level 5, Challenge 1:  Disorderly Escape

Oh no! You've managed to free the bunny workers and escape Commander Lambdas exploding space station, but Lambda's team of elite starfighters has flanked your ship. If you dont jump to hyperspace, and fast, youll be shot out of the sky!

Problem is, to avoid detection by galactic law enforcement, Commander Lambda planted the space station in the middle of a quasar quantum flux field. In order to make the jump to hyperspace, you need to know the configuration of celestial bodies in the quadrant you plan to jump through. In order to do *that*, you need to figure out how many configurations each quadrant could possibly have, so that you can pick the optimal quadrant through which youll make your jump.

There's something important to note about quasar quantum flux fields' configurations: when drawn on a star grid, configurations are considered equivalent by grouping rather than by order. That is, for a given set of configurations, if you exchange the position of any two columns or any two rows some number of times, youll find that all of those configurations are equivalent in that way -- in grouping, rather than order.

Write a function solution(w, h, s) that takes 3 integers and returns the number of unique, non-equivalent configurations that can be found on a star grid w blocks wide and h blocks tall where each celestial body has s possible states. Equivalency is defined as above: any two star grids with each celestial body in the same state where the actual order of the rows and columns do not matter (and can thus be freely swapped around). Star grid standardization means that the width and height of the grid will always be between 1 and 12, inclusive. And while there are a variety of celestial bodies in each grid, the number of states of those bodies is between 2 and 20, inclusive. The solution can be over 20 digits long, so return it as a decimal string.  The intermediate values can also be large, so you will likely need to use at least 64-bit integers.

For example, consider w=2, h=2, s=2. We have a 2x2 grid where each celestial body is either in state 0 (for instance, silent) or state 1 (for instance, noisy).  We can examine which grids are equivalent by swapping rows and columns.

```
00
00
```

In the above configuration, all celestial bodies are "silent" - that is, they have a state of 0 - so any swap of row or column would keep it in the same state.

```
00 00 01 10
01 10 00 00
```

1 celestial body is emitting noise - that is, has a state of 1 - so swapping rows and columns can put it in any of the 4 positions.  All four of the above configurations are equivalent.

```
00 11
11 00
```

2 celestial bodies are emitting noise side-by-side.  Swapping columns leaves them unchanged, and swapping rows simply moves them between the top and bottom.  In both, the *groupings* are the same: one row with two bodies in state 0, one row with two bodies in state 1, and two columns with one of each state.

```
01 10
01 10
```

2 noisy celestial bodies adjacent vertically. This is symmetric to the side-by-side case, but it is different because there's no way to transpose the grid.

```
01 10
10 01
```

2 noisy celestial bodies diagonally.  Both have 2 rows and 2 columns that have one of each state, so they are equivalent to each other.

```
01 10 11 11
11 11 01 10
```

3 noisy celestial bodies, similar to the case where only one of four is noisy.

```
11
11
```

4 noisy celestial bodies.

There are 7 distinct, non-equivalent grids in total, so solution(2, 2, 2) would return 7.


# Level 5, Bonus 1:  Expanding Nebula

You've escaped Commander Lambda's exploding space station along with numerous escape pods full of bunnies. But -- oh no! -- one of the escape pods has flown into a nearby nebula, causing you to lose track of it. You start monitoring the nebula, but unfortunately, just a moment too late to find where the pod went. However, you do find that the gas of the steadily expanding nebula follows a simple pattern, meaning that you should be able to determine the previous state of the gas and narrow down where you might find the pod.

From the scans of the nebula, you have found that it is very flat and distributed in distinct patches, so you can model it as a 2D grid. You find that the current existence of gas in a cell of the grid is determined exactly by its 4 nearby cells, specifically, (1) that cell, (2) the cell below it, (3) the cell to the right of it, and (4) the cell below and to the right of it. If, in the current state, exactly 1 of those 4 cells in the 2x2 block has gas, then it will also have gas in the next state. Otherwise, the cell will be empty in the next state.

For example, let's say the previous state of the grid (p) was:

```
.O..
..O.
...O
O...
```

To see how this grid will change to become the current grid (c) over the next time step, consider the 2x2 blocks of cells around each cell.  Of the 2x2 block of [p[0][0], p[0][1], p[1][0], p[1][1]], only p[0][1] has gas in it, which means this 2x2 block would become cell c[0][0] with gas in the next time step:

```
.O -> O
..
```

Likewise, in the next 2x2 block to the right consisting of [p[0][1], p[0][2], p[1][1], p[1][2]], two of the containing cells have gas, so in the next state of the grid, c[0][1] will NOT have gas:

```
O. -> .
.O
```

Following this pattern to its conclusion, from the previous state p, the current state of the grid c will be:

```
O.O
.O.
O.O
```

Note that the resulting output will have 1 fewer row and column, since the bottom and rightmost cells do not have a cell below and to the right of them, respectively.

Write a function solution(g) where g is an array of array of bools saying whether there is gas in each cell (the current scan of the nebula), and return an int with the number of possible previous states that could have resulted in that grid after 1 time step.  For instance, if the function were given the current state c above, it would deduce that the possible previous states were p (given above) as well as its horizontal and vertical reflections, and would return 4. The width of the grid will be between 3 and 50 inclusive, and the height of the grid will be between 3 and 9 inclusive.  The solution will always be less than one billion (10^9).
